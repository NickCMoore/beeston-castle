## User Testing
I sent a deployed link to the website to many family members and friends who provide constructive feedback and also simulated the various user cases (listed at the beginning of the Readme document) who might visit the site. This testing gave me an opportunity to see how the website would perform on a range of devices. No major display and navigation issues were encountered.
