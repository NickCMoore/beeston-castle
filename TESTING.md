## User Testing  <a name="user-testing"></a>
I sent a deployed link to the website to many family members and friends who provide constructive feedback and also simulated the various user cases (listed at the beginning of the Readme document) who might visit the site. This testing gave me an opportunity to see how the website would perform on a range of devices. No major display and navigation issues were encountered.

## Browser Testing <a name="browser-testing"></a>
The website was tested by myself on a range of modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Brave and Firefox. Load times were quick and no specific issues were encountered during this phase of testing.

## Compatability and Responsiveness Testing <a name="compatability-responsiveness-testing"></a>
The website was tested on various monitors including a 27 inch monitor (3840 x 2160), a laptop (1920 x 1080), an iPhone 13 Pro (390 x 844) and an iPad (1536 x 2048). All media queries coded in CSS executed correctly when required.

I also tested the website at different resolutions throughout the build process on Google Chrome Dev Tools. The following simulated devices were tested on Dev Tools - Galaxy Fold (280 x 653), iPhone 12 Pro (390 x 844), iPad Air (820 x 1180). In Dev Tools, I also tested the devices at the following common resolutions - 1280 x 720 (HD), 1920 X 1080 (FHD), 2560 X 1440 (QHD) and 3840 X 2160 (4K).

To double check the responsiveness and use an alternative to Dev Tools, I used the [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/) site to test all of the above resolutions.

The website was run through both the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
